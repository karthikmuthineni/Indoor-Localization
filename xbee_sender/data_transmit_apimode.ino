This example is for Series 1 XBee
Sends a TX16 or TX64 request with the value of analogRead(pin5) and checks the status response for success
Note: In my testing it took about 15 seconds for the XBee to start reporting success, so I've added a startup delay
*/

// allocate two bytes for to hold a 10-bit analog reading
uint8_t payload[] = { 'K', 'A', 'R' };

// with Series 1 you can use either 16-bit or 64-bit addressing

// 16-bit addressing: Enter address of remote XBee, typically the coordinator
//Tx16Request tx = Tx16Request(0x1874, payload, sizeof(payload));

// 64-bit addressing: This is the SH + SL address of remote XBee
XBeeAddress64 addr64 = XBeeAddress64(0x0013a200, 0x416c4a77);
// unless you have MY on the receiving radio set to FFFF, this will be received as a RX16 packet
Tx64Request tx = Tx64Request(addr64, payload, sizeof(payload));
